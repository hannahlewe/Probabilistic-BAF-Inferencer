# Probabilistic-BAF-Inferencer

Main application for Probabilistic Inference in Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks and additional helpful programs 
(i.e. Naive Probability Calculator and Model Generator)

## How to use

1) Clone the repository via `git clone`

```
git clone https://github.com/hannahlewe/Probabilistic-BAF-Inferencer.git
```

2) Use the BAFInferencer application by navigating to its location and executing the BAFInferencer.jar
(Manual included in the GUI under Tab "Help")

```
java -jar BAFInferencer.jar
```

3) Use the ModelGenerator application by navigation to its location and executing the ModelGeneretor.jar
Will output a generated model as a .txt file to your homedirectory

```
java -jar ModelGenerator.jar -n <nodes> {-d|-s|-p}
  -n,--nodes      number of nodes in model
  -d,--dense      creates random model with 80% density (default)
  -s,--sparse     creates random model with 50% density
  -p,--polytree   creates connected polytree model
```

4) All models generated by the ModelGenerator are guaranteed to be correct input to the BAFInferencer application
